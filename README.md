# ExecLock
A launcher script that prevents concurrent execution of a program. If another instance is already running, it skips launching a new oneâ€”unless a wait time is specified. Start time, end time, and any warnings and errors encountered are logged to syslog (/tmp/syslog.log). 

## Usage:
__/jffs/scripts/exec-lock.sh__ _[script to run]_ _[optional wait period in seconds]_  

    /jffs/scripts/exec-lock.sh /jffs/scripts/cake-connmark/cake-connmark.sh 30

## Syslog Sample Messages:

## Script Alias (optional):
exec-lock.sh scans the target script for a #SCRIPT-ALIAS:[alias] comment and uses the alias in syslog entries instead of the actual script name. 

For example, if cake-connmark.sh contains #SCRIPT-ALIAS:CAKE-ConnMark, that alias will appear in the syslog logs:

    May 25 21:58:00 SlashUsrVin: exec-lock.sh [INFO]: CAKE-ConnMark launched at Sun May 25 21:48:00 GMT 2025
    May 25 21:58:02 SlashUsrVin: exec-lock.sh [INFO]: CAKE-ConnMark    ended at Sun May 25 21:48:02 GMT 2025 -- 0 minute(s) 2 second(s)

When script has no alias:

    May 25 21:58:00 SlashUsrVin: exec-lock.sh [INFO]: cake-connmark.sh launched at Sun May 25 21:48:00 GMT 2025
    May 25 21:58:02 SlashUsrVin: exec-lock.sh [INFO]: cake-connmark.sh    ended at Sun May 25 21:48:02 GMT 2025 -- 0 minute(s) 2 second(s)
